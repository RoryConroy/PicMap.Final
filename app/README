This app has been developed by Rory Conroy(20080846) for the Mobile App Development module.
This app is originally based off the Placemark labs.
The purpose of this app is to store images with a title, description, image and then the location in which it was taken.
I decided to develop this app because i would like to be able to look back on images and see where i captured them with extra details such as the title and a description.
